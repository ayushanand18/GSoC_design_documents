# new issues from proposal:
- [x] Update pyobis to use the new API
     - [x] Merge in URL changes done on the forks
- [ ] Make MoF response more efficient
    * returns list of dataframes so it's more usable
    * currently nested table each occurrence has nested measurment or fact
    * some trick to use pandas to pull out the nested part (`json.normalize`?)
- [ ] Create tutorial usage of each module
- [ ] Clarify listing of GBIF instead of OBIS in package description ref ([ref](https://github.com/iobis/pyobis/blob/master/setup.py#L25))
    * add link to pyGBIF?
    * use a notebook leveraging both pyGBIF & pyOBIS?
- [x] Increase test coverage
- [ ] Use CI push to PyPI
    * discussed w/ Felipe : used to do it w/ Travis CI, need to switch to gh-actions
+ Create a Jupyter notebooks
    * what are "use cases" for each notebook?
    * search for relevant papers using OBIS|GBIF data & reproduce results in jupyter
    + [ ] see how species are moving downwards due to climate change.
     *  search MoF for depth measurements & report on % that have it.
     *  [relevant paper](https://doi.org/10.1111/geb.13414)
     - [ ] see how species are shifting north/south due to climate change.
    + can potentially publish notebooks to [JOSS](https://joss.theoj.org/)
- [ ] create CONTRIBUTING.md
- [ ] pyobis.visualize
    + create separate repo?
    * keeps pyobis dependencies light
    * makes viz libarary potentially usable w/ GBIF & other DwC data
+ look into [coveralls coverage](https://coveralls.io/github/sckott/pyobis?branch=master)
    * does it work w/ gh-actions?
    * is coverage 62%? if so: how to make it 100%?
    * maybe it just needs the badges changed
