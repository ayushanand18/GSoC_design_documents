new issues to open:


### Ayush
1. [X] occurrence pagination (use default size 5000)
2. [X] MoF accessibility (duplicate columns)
2. [X] MoF Null Records : if there are 0 records for species, our implementation of MoF returns error. needs null check.
2. [ ] + quality checks. need a manually-curated list (or spreadsheet) of issues found. Like obistools in R.
    implement like `pyobis.qualitycheck.occurrence_df()`; keep the checks seperate from bulk of pyobis code.
2. [ ] expand README to make approachable for beginners. 

### Tylar
3. [x] investigate pagination mentions in API usage docs (swagger just for endpoints, not usage)
2. [x] occurrence `size` & `after` params not documented in swagger
4. [X] progress bar
4. [ ] investigate merge duplicated columns (just dropping them for now, but I am curious why pd.df.merge is retaining duplicate columns)
4. ~~[ ] is last_page needed in robis? [ref](https://github.com/iobis/robis/search?q=last_page)~~
4. [ ] bring in MoF analysis as notebook (blue whale stuff from IOOS in michigan)
1. [ ] midterm evaluation
