## The Afternoon

> If you have come untill here with me then I must thank you. Thank you for bearing with me and reading this blog from a very boring man! 

The clock is now ticking afternoon. It's time for us to time travel back to May 20th. 

I am into the coding period and the project board is in front of my eyes. I open VS Code and fetch changes from GitHub first. **This has been my daily routine throughout this summer. Nothing interesting? Yup, I just said it at first - I am very boring person. Nothing interesting, not all.**

But I had been working consistently on my project almost everyday. For the first third of the period I wasn't able to contribute much since I was busy with academics at my college. I had back-to-back 27 exams in around 60 days.
