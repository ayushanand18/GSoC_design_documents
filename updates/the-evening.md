## The Evening

> This is the concluding part of my three-part GSoC journey blog, and if you have come up till here reading the other two parts then, THANK YOU SO MUCH! Thank you for bearing with me and reading with patience this boring guy. But if you haven't read the other two parts and jumped in straight here then, thank you for stopping here. However, I'd suggest you to give the first two parts [this](./what-gsoc-taught-me-the-morning.md) and [this](./the-afternoon.md) a read to get into the flow.

It is evening right now, and we are already on the third part of the blog. I am not sure whether I have been able to keep you still in the flow because the former of the two parts of this series were lengthy, extremely lengthy. But I will try to keep this as short as possible while avoiding every chance of an abrupt ending, afterall I don't write crime thrillers!

So, I have already talked a lot about most of the technical details of the project. And those which I left were mostly too deep to be included in a blog post. I don't expect my readers to be explicitly from a very technical background, but I do expect them to get an idea of how GSoC works after reading it. I am myself a tech geek but I do love writing a lot (I hope you would have known this fact untill now). But as a developer you mostly write two things: 
+ a. code, and
+ b. documentation. 

The former we write too much that we get bored writing the latter. But the latter one is very crucial step in the software development process. While contributing to an open source project if there's any critical thing after code, it is communication, documenting every change, every idea. And this is the most crucial part of GSoC. More than the project, GSoC focuses on building an ecosystem of open source developers, bringing more people into open source and help make it easy for beginners to get in.
