## The Evening

> This is the concluding part of my three-part GSoC journey blog, and if you have come up till here reading the other two parts then, THANK YOU SO MUCH! Thank you for bearing with me and reading with patience this boring guy. But if you haven't read the other two parts and jumped in straight here then, thank you for stopping here. However, I'd suggest you to give the first two parts [this](./what-gsoc-taught-me-the-morning.md) and [this](./the-afternoon.md) a read to get into the flow.
