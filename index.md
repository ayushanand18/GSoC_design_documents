> Making ocean biodiversity data easily accessible with python (pyobis revamp)

### Introduction
[pyobis](https://github.com/iobis/pyobis) is an interesting python package that helps users
fetch data from OBIS API which holds a great amount of ocean open-data, with ease. This project
is intended to update the existing pyobis python package to use the new OBIS API v3 and ensure 
the package is used for product generation in the future.

The pyobis package is really powerful and can fetch huge records of marine species,
particularly in the indo-pacific ocean region, and regions near the US, UK, and Australian
coastline. It is interesting to note that OBIS also holds data for species even dating back to
around 1078 AD, which makes pyobis even more essential to be maintained.
